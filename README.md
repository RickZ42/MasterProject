# MasterProject

# This is the raw script github for master project: genome biology of pollinator adaptation in the orchid Chiloglottis trpeziformis.

All supplementary material mentioned in my thesis can be found in the current path:

This project have three part:
    
    First, Use ONT, HiFi and HiC as input us Hifisam to finish telomere to telomere reference genome assembly for Chiloglottis trpeziformis.

    Second, do gene annotation and functional annotation.

    Third, do compartative genomic analysis and gene family analysis
