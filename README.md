# This is the raw script for master project: genome biology of pollinator adaptation in the orchid Chiloglottis trpeziformis.

This project will have three part:
    First, Use ONT, HiFi and HiC as input us Hifisam to finish telomere to telomere reference genome assembly for Chiloglottis trpeziformis.

    Second, do gene annotation and functional annotation.

    Third, do compartative genomic analysis
