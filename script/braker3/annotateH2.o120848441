# WARNING: 
# The hints file(s) for GeneMark-EX contain less than 1000 introns. (In total, 7 unique introns are contained.)
# Genemark-EX might fail due to the low number of hints.

# WARNING: 
# The hints file(s) for GeneMark-EX contain less than 150 introns with multiplicity >= 4! (In total, 7 unique introns are contained. 5 have a multiplicity >= 4.)
# Possibly, you are trying to run braker.pl on data that does not provide sufficient multiplicity information. This will e.g. happen if you try to use introns generated from assembled RNA-Seq transcripts; or if you try to run braker.pl in epmode with mappings from proteins without sufficient hits per locus. Or if you use the example data set.
# A low number of intron hints with sufficient multiplicity may result in a crash of GeneMark-EX (it should not crash with the example data set).

# WARNING: Number of reliable training genes is low (207). Recommended are at least 600 genes
