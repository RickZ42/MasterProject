Writing orthogroups to file
---------------------------
OrthoFinder assigned 486734 genes (93.4% of total) to 25116 orthogroups. Fifty percent of all genes were in orthogroups with 34 or more genes (G50 was 34) and were contained in the largest 4085 orthogroups (O50 was 4085). There were 7 orthogroups with all species present and 0 of these consisted entirely of single-copy genes.
