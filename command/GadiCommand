After you write this script, you can submit it with:

qsub {your script}

After submission, you will get a job id

Then you can trace your job progress with the job id provided:

qstat -fx {job_id}

If you forget your job id

qstat -u zz3507 -sw

If you want to delete job:

qdel {job_id}

You can check space already used by your project:

nci_account -P xf3


qsub -I -q express -P xf3 -lwalltime=00:05:00,ncpus=4,mem=16GB,jobfs=200GB,storage=gdata/xf3+scratch/xf3,wd

source /g/data/xf3/miniconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh

conda create -p /g/data/xf3/rick/envs/<package_name>

conda activate /g/data/xf3/rick/envs/<package_name>

conda install -c bioconda <package_name>
