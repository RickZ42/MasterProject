NAME
    BuildDatabase - Format FASTA files for use with RepeatModeler

SYNOPSIS
      BuildDatabase [-options] -name "mydb" <seqfile(s) in fasta format>
     or 
      BuildDatabase [-options] -name "mydb" 
                                  -dir <dir containing fasta files *.fa, *.fasta,
                                         *.fast, *.FA, *.FASTA, *.FAST, *.dna,
                                         and  *.DNA > 
     or
      BuildDatabase [-options] -name "mydb" 
                                  -batch <file containing a list of fasta files>

DESCRIPTION
      This is basically a wrapper around AB-Blast's and NCBI Blast's
      DB formating programs.  It assists in aggregating files for processing 
      into a single database.  Source files can be specified by:

          - Placing the names of the FASTA files on the command
            line.
          - Providing the name of a directory containing FASTA files 
            with the file suffixes *.fa or *.fasta.
          - Providing the name of a manifest file which contains the 
            names of FASTA files ( fully qualified ) one per line.

      NOTE: Sequence identifiers are not preserved in this database. Each
            sequence is assigned a new GI ( starting from 1 ).  The 
            translation back to the original sequence is preserved in the
            *.translation file.

    The options are:

    -h(elp)
        Detailed help

    -name <database name>
        The name of the database to create.

    -dir <directory>
        The name of a directory containing fasta files to be processed. The
        files are recognized by their suffix. Only *.fa and *.fasta files
        are processed.

    -batch <file>
        The name of a file which contains the names of fasta files to
        process. The files names are listed one per line and should be fully
        qualified.
